# rock-paper-scissors

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game

I created this game using CSS, HTML, and JS

The game starts with an open modal that asks for a user to input their username or continue as guest.
To play the game, select any choice button and Mr. Robot will use a randomly selected choice.
Score will be kept including the amount of ties there are. If you feel like you could beat Mr. Robot, the user can
select the reset button which will set all values to zero and open the modal to ask for username input again.\

To create the logic of this game I created two objects a user object and a robot object. Both objects contain score
and have methods to increment their scores. The robot object however also contains an array of choices and has an
additional getter method to get that choice calculated from a random index. The game compares the choice of the user and
the random choice of the robot to make a decision of who wins or not.

I hope you enjoy playing my game!
